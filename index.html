                    what is the return Policy

                <div class="answer">
                    Policy small refers to policies that are targeted towards specific, narrow issues or populations. 
                    These policies are designed to address a particular problem or need in a targeted way,
                    rather than trying to solve a broad range of issues at once.
                    Examples of policy small could include a program to provide free school meals to low-income children,
                    or a policy to improve accessibility for people with disabilities in public transportation.
                    The advantage of policy small is that it allows policymakers to focus their resources and efforts on a specific issue,
                    which can lead to more effective outcomes.
